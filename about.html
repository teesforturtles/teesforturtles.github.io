	<h2>~About~</h2>
	<p>I am a 13 year old middle school student in Vienna, VA. Every 7th grade student at my school creates their own "Do Hard Things" project (DHT for short), inspired by the book <em>Do Hard Things</em> by Alex and Brett Harris. These projects must be hard, but doable in the two years of middle school. 
	My family has gone to the beach in the Outer Banks every year for as long as I can remember. This past summer, a section of the beach was roped off. A volunteer with the organization N.E.S.T. (Network for Endangered Sea Turtles) told us that it was a sea turtle nest. They were waiting for sea turtle eggs buried beneath the sand to hatch and the babies to make their way back to the ocean. I really enjoyed talking with the volunteers and this inspired my DHT project.
	For my project, I combined my interests in computer programming and drawing with my love of marine animals. I founded Tees for Turtles to help raise money and awareness for sea turtles. I designed original t-shirts with a couple of my drawings, and I programmed this website using HTML and CSS. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
