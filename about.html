	<h2>~About~</h2>
	<p>Tees for Turtles was founded in 2016 by a 13 year-old middle school student. At her school in Vienna, VA, each student had to come up with a project over the summer. These projects were called Do Hard Things projects (DHT for short). Each project had to be hard, but doable in the 2-year span of middle school. Every year her family went to Corolla, NC for a week in the summer. On their 2015 trip, her family spotted a roped off area and a group of people watching some sand. They informed her that underneath the sand was a turtle nest, and that they were volunteers with an organization called N.E.S.T. Because she loves animals (especially marine life), art, and computer science, she decided that for her DHT project, she would sell t-shirts that she designed herself and donate the money to N.E.S.T. In addition to that, she also decided to program this website using her knowledge of HTML and CSS.</p>
