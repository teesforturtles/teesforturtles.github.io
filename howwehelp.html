	<h2>~How We Help~</h2>
	
<p>The t-shirt you just ordered could change the lives of our frippery friends!! Today, there are six species of sea turtles that nest at the Outer Banks. The money you pay for a shirt will be donated to N.E.S.T., a non-profit organization that helps the sea turtles on O.B.X. N.E.S.T. stands for Network for Endangered Sea Turtles. Our donations help pay for veterinary bills, purchase rehabilitation supplies, and cover transportation costs. To find out more about what N.E.S.T. does, <a href="http://www.nestonline.org/">CLICK HERE.</a> </p>
<h2>~Threats to Sea Turtles~</h2>
<div class="threats">
<p>You might be wondering why the sea turtes need your help. Here are some threats that are impacting turtle populations: </p>
</div>
<h3>Artifical Lighting</h3>
	<p>When baby sea turtles hatch, they rely on moonlight to find the ocean because most sae turtles hatch during the night. Beach houses with lights that face the beach look alot like the moon to a newly hatched sea turte, which results in the turtles never making it to sea. <h3>How YOU can help:</h3> Turn off any lights that face the ocean!</p>
<h3>Oil Spills and Marine Pollution</h3>
	<p>Marine pollutants such as toxic metals, PCBs, fertilizers, chemicals, and some petroleum products can harm sea turtles both directly and indirectly. They can cause serious health issues, and kill the turtle's food. Oil is very harmful, even though it doesn't tend to stick to them, oil can still get in their eyes, skin, and lungs which cause health problems. Oil also kills seagrass, which is a main part of the green turtle's diet. The hawksbill sea turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, and Kemp's ridley sea turtle's diets all contian certain sponges and invertebrates. Sponges and invertebrates have suffered population losses due to oil, and turtles have also been found to grow weak and vunerable after extended exposure to oil. There is also the prblem of tar ingestion, which can lead to swelling that can dislocate intestines and liver. Contamination of the turtle's food can have effects on the digestive tract. If sea turtle eggs get expossed to oil the changes of survival are greatly decreased as the hatchlings will most likely have physical deformities.</p> 
 <h3>How YOU can help:</h3> <p>Make sure you aren't using to much fertilizer on you flowers, because excess fertilizer can run off into the ocean. Just a small act like this will decrease the amount of harmful toxics in our waters!</p>
<h3>Ocean Plastic</h3>
	<p>Trash such as plastic bags resemble jellyfish, a common source of food for sea turtles. If a turtle eats it, the plastic can clog it's digestive system and can kill the turtle.</p>
<h3>How YOU can help:</h3> <p>Keep track of your trash! If you see litter laying around, pick it up. Even if you don't live close to the ocean, the trash will wind up there eventually.</p>
